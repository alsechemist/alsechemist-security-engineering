Validation
==========

In this page will see and validate if a malicious attacker or IP is actually blocked.

Linux Agents
------------

To check **Wazuh Active Response -** ``firewall-drop`` script has actually blocked a malicious IP. We need to check ``iptables`` rules list,
as the script leverages ``iptables`` to do its job. Copy and past the command below in your Linux Agent and make sure you have ``sudo`` privileges.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo iptables -L

You should see ``iptables`` blocked the malicious IP.

Windows Agents
--------------

To check **Wazuh Active Response -** ``netsh`` script has actually blocked a malicious IP. We need to check ``netsh`` rules list, or
we can check **Windows Defender Firewall** rules through the ``Advanced Settings``. Copy and past the command below in your Windows Agent and make sure you have ``administrative`` privileges.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo iptables -L

You should see ``iptables`` blocked the malicious IP.
